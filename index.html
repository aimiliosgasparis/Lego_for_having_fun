  <p>The story of the LEGO Group began in 1932 in Denmark as a small carpentry business that evolved into one of the world's leading toy manufacturers. Its success is rooted in the simple, high-quality interlocking plastic brick and the philosophy of "play well" (from the
Danish phrase "leg godt" which inspired the name "LEGO"). The LEGO Group was founded by Danish carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen in his workshop in Billund, Denmark. Faced with the economic hardship of the Great Depression, Christiansen diversified from furniture and
household goods into making wooden toys, such as yo-yos, cars, and ducks. A pivotal shift occurred after World War II, in 1947, when Christiansen bought an expensive plastic injection-molding machine, one of the first in Denmark, signaling a move towards modern materials.
This was a significant investment, costing more than twice the company's previous year's profits. In 1949, the company produced its first plastic interlocking bricks, called "Automatic Binding Bricks," inspired by British toymaker Hilary Fisher Page's Kiddicraft bricks.
The Modern Brick and System of Play the original plastic bricks had limited "clutch power" or locking ability. This changed in 1958 when Christiansen's son, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, who had become junior managing director, developed and patented the iconic stud-and-tube
coupling system that provides the robust interlocking capability of the modern LEGO brick. This design is the foundation of the "LEGO System in Play," a concept where all bricks, regardless of size or set, can fit together. 
Tragedy struck again with fires in 1942 and a final fire in 1960 that destroyed the entire wooden toy inventory. The 1960 fire forced the company to abandon wooden toy production entirely and focus solely on the plastic system, a decision that cemented its future. 
Global Expansion and Diversification.

The first LEGOLAND Park opened in Billund, Denmark at 1968.
The Duplo system, featuring larger, safer bricks for toddlers, was launched at 1969.
The more complex LEGO Technic line was introduced, targeting older children at 1977.
The iconic LEGO Minifigure was introduced, adding characters to the building sets and enabling richer storytelling at 1978.
The launch of the Star Wars theme marked the beginning of highly successful licensed intellectual property (IP) partnerships, which include franchises like Harry Potter and Marvel Comics at 1999.</p>
